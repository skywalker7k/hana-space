// Jesus I need you
  Jesus I need you
  every moment I need you
  hear now this grace bought heart
  sing out your praise forever
  Christ before me
  Christ behind me
  your love surrounds me
  never failing
  
  I was caught in he weight of the world on my shoulders
  trying to fight my own battles
  but my heart's getting colder
  then you called out my name in the middle of night
  gave me peace in the chaos turned my wrongs int right
  when the valley gets deep when the storm starts to rise
  I will lift up my hands put my faith in the skies
  you never left me alone never turned from my cry
  so I walk in your promise with my head held high
  
  beauty from ashes
  you heal the broken
  you lift the weak up
  your word is spoken
  you take my burdens
  you shine as the light
  leading me forward
  out of the night
  
  Jesus I need you
  every moment I need you
  hear now this grace bought heart
  sing out your praise forever
  Christ before me
  Christ behind me
  your love surrounds me
  never failing
  
  when the enemy whispers try to tell me I'm through
  I just stand on your promise
  Lord I cling to your truth
  ain't no weapon that's formed gonna prosper or stay
  cause your mercy and love always light up my way
  I've been low I've been down
  I've been lost in the fight
  but your hand pull me up now I'm walking in light
  you restore you redeem
  Lord you make all things new
  so I lift up my voice giving glory to you
  
  remember love
  remember mercy
  Christ before me
  Christ behind me
  your love and kindness
  ///? never failed me (2:08)
  Christ before me
  Christ behind me
  Jesus I need you
  every moment I need you
  hear now this grace bought heart
  sing out your praise forever
  Christ before me
  Christ behind me
  your love surrounds me never failing
  
  now I'm stepping in faith
  no more fear in my soul
  every ??? (Let me) trial I face Lord you're still in control
  you took my shame turned it into a song
  now I walk with a purpose I know I belong
  every tear that I cried you collected them all
  every time that I fell you still answered my call
  so I'll run to your arms where my rescue is found
  and I'll sing of your love till the trumpets sound
  
  Jesus I need you
  every moment I need you
  hear now this grace bought heart
  sing out your praise forever
  Christ before me
  Christ behind me
  your love surrounds me never failing
  
  your love never fails
  your grace never fades
  throught the highs and the lows
  you have always stayed
  I will trust I will praise
  I will stand in your name
  forever and always you remain the same the same
